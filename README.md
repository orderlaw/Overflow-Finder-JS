# Overflow-Finder-JS

Suppose you created a beautiful website, you wrote your code very carefully and also you made this website responsive so it will look awesome on phone an other devices. Then you open the website in your phone and you see that the x-axis scroll is occuring to your whole webpage and you're confused what happened... then you go back to your code and try to solve this error by finding out which div is causing the x-overflow and this can be pretty exhausting... the worst case- even after going through the whole code you never find the solution. So keeping that in mind, I've brought you all a cool js code that may help you out in such a situation where you want to locate a overflowing div (or whatever element you wanna target) easily.

This repo will help you in finding overflow elements in a website, simply open your website on any web browser, then go to inspect, open console, and then paste this code in console and press enter.
